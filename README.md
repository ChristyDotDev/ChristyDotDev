### Hi there

I'm a software engineer, based in Scotland. I've spent my days for most of the last decade writing very boring software;
mostly high availability, high throughput financial systems. I could try writing those in my spare time too
but it'll probably mostly be hacky hobby projects related to sports and videgames.

### 🔨 I’m currently working on
 - An [entry](https://github.com/christytc10/bigdatacup21) for the Big Data Cup. I have no idea what I'm doing
 - Mucking about with F1 2020 [game telemetry](https://github.com/christytc10/f12020-twitch)
 - A 2D game in Godot
 - A simple blog in jekyll

### 🎒 I’m currently learning
 - R and Data analysis in general
 - Godot Engine, and been using C# in it

### 🤝 I’m looking to collaborate on
 - Anything free/open source really
